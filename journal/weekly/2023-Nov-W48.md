### Worth remembering
- Watched [[Homestory Cup 24]] with [[Sam]], took notes for finals
- Started cataloging workout sets/reps
-  got into [[Age of Empires IV]] a bit myself, played new muslim and rus campaigns
- Woke up one day and wrote an essay of sorts on my feelings for [[Sam]], [[2023-29-11]]
- Had a pathethic Eren moment when [[Sam]] said she wasn't gonna play [[Baldur's Gate]] with me, but someone else
- At the time I almost felt like removing her or going full apathetic/distance mode, but well. I still haven't sorted my feelings out 100% but maybe I overreacted

### Future goals
- Oauth Work stuff
- password work stuff
- keep working out and increasing reps
- Do mobility stuff every legday
- think about future, job, living, long-term. etc.
