Today I couldn't sleep, mind racing. I woke up at 5 am and wrote down some thoughts I had about [[Sam]]. I wrote them into discord but I should keep them here instead. Here are the transcripts.

When I'm in bed my mind tends to wander, and often it wanders into topics and situations involving you
some things that were racing through my head tonight so that I couldn't sleep:

1. on the finite nature of our relationship
	this relationship dynamic we have and have had for over a decade now is finite and really is coming to an end probably sooner than we would think/like
	it's a difficult thing to think about because on some level u been a big part of my life for so long it feels almost second nature, so thinking about it radically changing is uncomfortable or weird 
	we are all grown up now, eventually we will settle down with partner and create family and we'll grow apart etc
	you said u wanted kids, and female fertility window starts to shrink after 35
	i know u mentioned once freezing ur eggs but i dunno, seems bit weird
	and prolly not healthy to wait till u older to have kids
	prolly kid is the most healthy if both father and mother are young and in prime age
	i assume u are 31 now so that is 4 years, and maybe u can push it a few years after that
	so we will have probably 4 years or so more of being friends the way we have been so far
	because things will change drastically once that happens
	u will at that time probably have found a girlfriend/wife to settle down with and "have kids",
	that in itself means our friendship will change a lot
	but on top of that, i dont think i'm comfortable with the idea of u being pregnant with some other person
	even if it is done clinically through a sperm bank with anonomous donor etc
	that is better ofc than doing it "naturally" with some donor, but it still makes me uncomfortable
	maybe sounds petty, disgusting or like it isn't a big deal to you
	but things just wouldn't be the same after that
	even thinking about the prospect fills me with a sort of reproductive gut-wrenching angst
	I would definitely distance myself from you, maybe develop resentment or antipathy 
2. on my feelings for you
	I'm not sure how I feel about you
	I am essentially of two minds
	and they are quite opposite
	Mind 1:
		My 'feelings' for you are not genuine.
		We have not met, we haven't even talked. You can't really know someone, feel their energy, without meeting them.
		People say 90% of human communication is non-verbal, well we haven't even talked verbally, only through text
		so do we even really know each other
		so knowing that, why do I still think I have feelings for you
		Because I'm using you essentially as an unhealthy coping mechanism for my own failed life/experiences
		instead of admitting I am a failure with women and social interaction in general, I cope to myself by thinking
		I dont care about anyone else, the only one I care about and want to pursue is Sam
		But since I don't really know the 'real' you, what I actually have feelings for is not you, the girl Samantha, but the girl I have conjured up in my head based on our decade of interactions 
		probably completely laced with my own unfounded desires and wants
		basically, this is unfair to you. It really is just my own unhealthy and creepy mental issue
		so it natural you been trying to distance urself romantically from me for ages  now, cause girls can no doubt sense this kind of insecure thing 
	Mind 2:
		I am obsessed with you
		I don't know if it is really love, since you can't really love someone you haven't met
		but you are literally the most important person
		in my life
		hm
		except maybe my brother
		but even then, for so so long we have talked essentially daily
		without you I am obscenely lonely
		I can numb myself for a while with frivolous entertainment like games and anime, but there is no doubt that you are the primary thing in my life that gives me comfort 
		that makes me feel not alone
		the thought of things, "us", coming to an end scares me
		like I said, I'm not sure if it's really "love", maybe it is indeed just an unhealthy emotional attachment I have to you.
		but does it really matter, it doesn't change how I feel now, and have felt for years and years
		I know things changed for you, that you at some point in ur mind put me in the "only talk online" box, ie. friendzoned 
		but for me, in my mind, you are more
		I think of you almost every day, usually in bed, my mind drifts to you, or fantasies involving you 
		and I don't mean pervy fantasies
		well, often it one of two things
		1.
			Supporting you as your rock
			I already told you that I really like the idea of, the "guy" saving the "girl"
			and I wanted to be that the last time, after you had ur traumatic first day at work
			and it really really bothered me how you said I didn't save you. Which is true I didn't
			I regret not doing anything at the time
			but at the same time I don't know what I could have done, cause you weren't being receptive
			like I want to but I dont know how, and feels like you don't want it either
			but yes I often fantasize about things of that nature, like you being nervous or anxious about work, being able to work a normal job etc, and putting my arms around you and calming you down
			you being unhappy with ur life and work and me coming in and saying i'll take care of you, financially and so on, giving you financial freedom, the upper class life u always dreamed of, and freedom from being anxious and nervous about these things 
			basically, a part of me wants you to be weak so I can then save you 
			making you feel, warm and safe and calm etc 
			probably typical guy stuff, wants to feel needed and relied on
			but I often fantasize about that
		2.
			well I wonder if I should put this into words, but probably not sharing this anyway
			But I often also fantasize about you essentially soft-doming me, the way you already kind of do in text, but in real life
			like, I want you to be a weak princess for me to save, but I also want to simp for you and have you be arrogant and bossy etc 
			I hesitate to right this but
			like, pushing me down and mounting me, looking into my eyes and telling me you are in control, or you own me
			or i am ur slave/dog/pet whatever
			something like this scene from that shadow eminence show 
			![[Pasted image 20231130024019.png]]
			kind of pathetic saying it out loud, but stuff like that
			abruptly telling me to get on my knees and eat u out 
			telling me to get on my knees and lick ur feet as you sitting
			and just that dominant, assertive, smug attitude that u seem to already have down
			i think i would enjoy being bossed around to a certain extend like that
			not always, but sometimes
			Sometimes I would want to do role reversal too
			I mean, I dont want to be dominated 24/7 or be whipped by some dominatrix in latex or crazy stuff like that
			but i would like these minor things sometimes
			and you are probably the reason I do, you acted dominant and abusive so long I think i developed kind of a fetish for it
			not that I dont have other fetishes that are completely different but also messed up,
			okay, I realize now that this was creepy pervy section, the point was that I fantasize about you a lot okay Sam 
			okay I am never sending this
	okay that was a lot, but the main point was, I don't know how I really feel about you, if it just unhealthy coping mechanism or obsession or neither
	and I think I wanted to meet you to sort out my own feelings too
	also cuz I feel like I am pressed for time cuz we are old etc
	but I want to reaffirm and promise you, on everything I hold dear, I would never assault you
	tbh this first meeting I promise I wont even touch you or get close to you at all
	I will be awkward, creepy and make you feel uncomfortable probably yes, but not intentionally
	and if I do touch you or something (which I wont), you can throw my pc out the window and chop of my penis 
	that is rly not why I want to meet
	tbh it terrifies me
	cuz like I said I am scared of change too, cause you mean a lot to me 
	I'm not even sure if I rly want to meet, if I am serious about this
	but I think I have to
	as it is we will never meet
	and I think it would be my biggest regret in life maybe
	not to meet you ever cause I was scared
3. meeting possibilities
	I think meeting you will have 1 of 4 effects on me 
	1. I see you and it love at first sight
	2. we meet, we talk, my image of you i have in my mind breaks, and I stop being obsessed with you, and stop having these feelings for you, and we can maybe be just normal friends
	3. We meet, it awkward, things end early cuz it way too awkward and we can't communicate probably verbally, nothing is resolved and it one huge fiasco
	4. we meet, talk, etc. my conjured image of u breaks, but I still have strong feeligns for the real you and if i had to guess the likeliness of these options i'd say something like
	1. 1%
	2. 9%
	3. 80%
	4. 10%
