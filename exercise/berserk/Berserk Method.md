	- add sets
	- add load
	- add density
	- add quality
need minimum amount of rep quality

## Double Progression
simple preferred way of achieving progressive overload metrics
- select rep range ex: 6-10
- Select Sets ex: 4
- increase weight when you get all sets/rips ex:4x10
- keep a couple in the tank on your first set
- autoregulate weights

Maybe look into pullovers
