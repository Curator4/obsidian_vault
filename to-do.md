well cuz i watched this youtube vlog from a girl today. short summary she "broke up" with her long time friend
her friend that she didnt see romantically but tried to stay friend with, even tho he had told her he loved her and wouldn't be interested in her as a friend if she had a boyfriend
then she got all depresssed yada yada, and even tho she was lesbian she slept with this guy becuz she wanted to have sex before killing herself. 
And the sex and intimacy with that guy apparently was best thing that ever happened to her, and now she called off things with the long term friend etc.

Now why do i feel upset, i guess because i see myself in that story, the parallels are obvious. Which in turn makes me question what i am doing, what we are doing.

then when i ran i came up with the idea that, sure, if she gets a boyfriend or sleeps with guy or something then i can let go completely. but untill then it better to just, take the high road and be better myself, make her want you, not be desperate for her.
if she rly is lesbian i guess we can just leave it at being friends, altho that is not what i want, and i will push for more
but at the same time she keeps giving mixed signals
