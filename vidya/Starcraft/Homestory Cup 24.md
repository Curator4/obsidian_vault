### Skillous vs Clem Semis
clem plays standard bio but adds a few tanks, me like
skillous played okay, but he mainly tried to bruteforce clem with 3-4 colus 3-6 disruptor and mass gate, nothing else. similar to harstem. he did well and had good macro, but just lost to liberators & ghosts
see skillous macro in last game ðŸŸ¥. But even with 2 extra bases he keeps losing too hard against libs.

### Serral vs Clem Finals
They both agreed to do bo5 isntead of bo7 because of the time
##### game 1
clem opens cyclone/hellion pressure, then transitions into marine tank, I love this guy
pretty standard game, serral just defends everyhting and overwhelms. I like the tanks tho

##### game  2
opens with marine tank push, liberator/hellion harass
![[Pasted image 20231204014111.png]]
serral eventually collapses and cleans it, cleans up subsequent pushes too that have more widow mines, less tanks
gets into long macro game with split map, but clem gets an early lead and maintains it throughout. Slowly suffocates serral without making mistakes
##### game 3
clem opens fast widow mine drop drop, doesn't do much, does a timing push with 2 tanks, mines, bio, gets completely stomped by roach, ling, bling.
goes late-game, serral has big lead from the early-game. clem does valiant effort at stabalizing but loses a crucial base at the end and calls gg.
##### game 4
early hellion/cyclone pressure again, into double ebay + barracks. "fake mech". loses stuff early, lings run through wall and kills 11 scvs early, disaster.
clem tries to recover but dies to serral roach/lurker push
final game ends at 2:30

# 3-1 Serral
