- vitamin D supplementation is generally considered safe in moderate amounts, but the upper limit for vitamin D is usually **4,000 IU per day** for most adults,
- deficiency can come from limited sun exposure

### biotin
- 30 to 100 micrograms (mcg) per day**.
- hair health, skin health, the hair/nails/skin vitamin, B7
# minerals
Minerals are inorganic nutrients that play crucial roles in various bodily functions, including bone health, nerve function, and fluid balance.
- **Major minerals** (e.g., calcium, magnesium, potassium) are required in larger amounts.
- **Trace minerals** (e.g., zinc, iron, iodine) are needed in smaller amounts but are still vital for health.
### selenium
- The recommended daily allowance (RDA) of selenium is **55 ug (micrograms)**.
- The safe upper limit for selenium is 400 micrograms a day in adults
- helps with sperm, cognitive boost, hair
### magnesium
- The Recommended Dietary Allowance (RDA) for adults 19-51+ years is _400-420 mg daily_
- red scare guy 200mg of elemental magnesium sourced from Magnesium Glycinate,
- muscle function, bones
- stress and sleep
### zink
- The Recommended Dietary Allowance (RDA) for adults 19+ years is _11 mg a day for men_
- **Zinc is likely safe when used in amounts no greater than 40 mg daily**.
- guy from redscare took 30mg Zinc Monomethionine,
- benefits immune system, skin (used for treating acne), cognitive function
- can interfere with copper absorption over 40 mg
# fatty acids
Fats are essential for energy storage, cell structure, and hormone production. There are **essential fatty acids** that the body cannot produce on its own and must obtain from food sources.
- **Omega-3 fatty acids** (e.g., EPA, DHA) are anti-inflammatory and support heart, brain, and joint health.
- **Omega-6 fatty acids** play a role in inflammatory responses and metabolism.
3 and 6 need to be balanced

- must be gained from food or supplements, fish, flaxseed
- helps heart
- helps brains
- helps joints and bones
- helps eyes
- helps skin including acne
# amino acids
Amino acids are the building blocks of proteins. They are critical for muscle growth, repair, and overall metabolic processes. Some amino acids are considered **essential** (the body cannot make them and must get them from food), while others are **non-essential** (the body can produce them).
### creatine
- rapid energy, more power and strenght -> more reps -> more muscles
- increases muscles size, makes u look more jacked
- speeds boosts muscle recovery
- cognitive function, mostly brain energy
- The typical **loading phase** involves taking **20-25 grams** of creatine per day for **5-7 days**, divided into 4-5 doses. This phase helps saturate your muscles with creatine more quickly.
- After the loading phase, you can switch to a **maintenance dose** of about **3-5 grams per day**.
### glycine

- In general, it's recommended that you **don't exceed 500 milligrams (mg) a day**.
- supposedly can help with stress, anxiet, insomnia, focus, mood
- usually used alongside caffeine to knock the negative side effects 
- tyrosine, tryptophan and taurin also can regulate brain, comparison:

|**Supplement**|**Main Effects**|**Best for**|**When to Use**|
|---|---|---|---|
|**L-Tryptophan**|Precursor to serotonin, improves mood, sleep, stress relief|**Mood improvement**, **sleep support**|When you need **mood enhancement**, **stress relief**, or **help with sleep**|
|**L-Theanine**|Increases alpha brain waves, reduces cortisol, improves focus|**Relaxation without sedation**, **stress reduction**, **focus**|When you need **calm focus** or **relaxation without drowsiness**|
|**Taurine**|Regulates neurotransmitters, supports mood, energy, cardiovascular health|**Mental calmness**, **energy boost**, **mood stabilization**|When you need **mental clarity** and **physical energy**|
|**L-Tyrosine**|Precursor to dopamine and norepinephrine, supports cognitive function and stress resistance|**Cognitive performance**, **stress resilience**, **focus**|When you need to perform well under **stress**, **maintain focus** in demanding situations|
- **L-Tryptophan** is best for improving mood and sleep by boosting **serotonin** levels.
- **L-Theanine** is perfect for promoting calmness and focus without sedation, helping you stay **relaxed but alert**.
- **Taurine** is good for mood stabilization and **physical energy** support. used in energy drinks
- **L-Tyrosine** is ideal when you need to **enhance cognitive performance** or **mental clarity** under stress. It’s particularly effective in **high-stress situations** where maintaining mental focus, alertness, and motivation is key.
### carnitine 
- also used in energy drinks, helps body burn fat
- could be great to take whilst cutting
# caffeine
- a naturally occuring psychoactive stimulant, blocks specific neurotransmitter
